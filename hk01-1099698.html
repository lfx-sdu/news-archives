<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In 2015, the
&quot;Government Work Report&quot; first proposed the &quot;Made in China
2025&quot; Hongda plan, and then the executive meeting of the State Council
deliberated and approved the &quot;Made in China 2025&quot;. When the
&quot;2025 Made in China&quot; was proposed, it seemed that this ideal was
still some time away from us. In the blink of an eye, 10 years have passed. In
the past 10 years of silence on &quot;Made in China 2025&quot;, what changes
have taken place?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>The goal of
&quot;Made in China 2025&quot; is simply to transform China from a
manufacturing power into a manufacturing powerhouse, achieving technological
self-sufficiency and reducing dependence on foreign technology and supply
chains. At the time, China was at the lower end of the global industrial value
chain, producing mostly cheap and technologically backward products, and Made
in China 2025 aims to change that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>The State
Council has listed the key areas of &quot;Made in China 2025&quot; to
vigorously promote breakthrough development: a new generation of information
technology industry, high-end CNC machines and robots, aerospace equipment,
marine engineering equipment and high-tech ships, advanced rail transit
equipment, energy-saving and new energy vehicles, power equipment, agricultural
machinery equipment, new materials, biomedicine and high-performance medical
equipment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>When
Secretary of State Marco Rubio was a senator from Florida in 2019, he published
a special report on &quot;Made in China 2025 and the Future of American
Industry&quot;, and in September last year, he published a sequel to <a
href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/PDFFiles/Marco-Rubio-The-World-China-Made.pdf"
target="_blank">the report, &quot;A World Built by China: Nine Years After Made
in China 2025&quot;.</a>(The World China Made:&quot;Made in China 2025&quot;
Nine Years Later) pointed out that nine of the 10 key industry targets set by
China have been basically achieved. These achievements cover a wide range of
core fields such as new energy vehicles, information technology, aerospace, and
power equipment, injecting strong impetus into the overall improvement of
China's manufacturing industry. There is also another media summary, Made in
China 2025, a total of 36 major projects are planned, and 35 have been
completed or basically completed on schedule, basically leaving chips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>According to
the progress chart of &quot;Made in China 2025&quot; released by Bloomberg, the
industries that are currently in the leading position (Global Leader) in China
are: drones, solar energy, graphene, high-speed rail, and electric vehicles. In
the past, two areas became global leaders. Industries with global
competitiveness include: semiconductors, artificial intelligence, robotics,
machines, pharmaceuticals, and large LNG carriers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In the past
10 years, six areas have gone from being globally backward to becoming globally
competitive, with impressive progress. Semiconductors, machines and
pharmaceuticals, which are often criticized, are considered by Bloomberg to be
globally competitive. The only industry behind is the commercial aircraft, but
it will also be globally competitive by 2030.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In other
words, no matter how it is divided, Made in China 2025 has a very high degree
of completion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>Broadly
speaking, the goal is to increase China's share of global manufacturing value
added. As of 2023, China's share of global manufacturing value added has risen
from 26% in 2015 to 29%. The plan aims to increase R&amp;D spending to 2.5% of
GDP by 2025. This goal has already been achieved ahead of schedule in 2023.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In terms of
fields, the most outstanding are energy-saving and new energy vehicles, and
power equipment. China's goal is to become a leader in clean energy technology.
Chinese companies now produce about 90 percent of the world's solar panels and
70 percent of the world's batteries, up from 65 percent and 47 percent
respectively in 2015. This field can be said to be a great success.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In terms of
automobiles, China's new energy vehicles account for 70% of the world's
production capacity. The original plan was to sell 3 million electric vehicles
by 2025. But in fact, sales in 2024 will exceed 10 million units, accounting
for nearly two-thirds of the global market. China's auto exports have become
the world's largest and are growing rapidly, and it is likely to become China's
largest export. Lithium-ion batteries also account for more than 70% of the
world's total.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In terms of
power equipment, China ranks first in the world in photovoltaic panels, wind
turbines, hydropower, thermal power, third-generation nuclear power, and
fourth-generation nuclear power, and China is the only one in terms of
fourth-generation high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear power technology. The
world has a monopoly on ultra-high voltage transmission, and China has
completely independent intellectual property rights, and even international
standards are China's business. For example, the Sichuan-Chongqing 1000 kV UHV
AC project is the first high-altitude UHV AC project, which has overcome the
key technologies of high-altitude UHV such as air gap, external insulation, and
electromagnetic environment. According to the data released by the World Energy
Statistical Yearbook 2024, in 2023, the total global power generation will be
299248 billion kWh, and China's total power generation will reach 9,456.4
billion kWh, accounting for 31.60% of the world's total power generation.
China's power generation will exceed 10 trillion kWh in 2024.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In terms of
high-end CNC machines and robots, China's robotics industry will grow in 2023,
accounting for 50% of the world's total, and Yushu Technology's robot dogs will
have a global market share of more than 70%. China is undoubtedly the world's
first-echelon country in the field of robotics. CNC machine bed has always been
known as the mother of industry, and it is also a key project for the country
to constantly pursue breakthroughs. China is already the world's largest
producer and consumer of CNC machines, with a total output value of 32% of the
world's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>From a
technical point of view, in the five-axis linkage CNC machine bed, CNC heavy
machine bed, vertical horizontal machining center, CNC lathe, CNC gear
processing machine bed and other parts, the technology has reached the world's
advanced level, breaking the foreign monopoly. However, there is still a gap
between the overall technological development and the top level, such as in
terms of accuracy retention and stability of the numerical control system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In terms of
marine engineering equipment and high-tech ships, there have been significant
breakthroughs in technology in the progress of marine engineering equipment,
such as the 400,000-ton FPSO project using a number of advanced technologies,
and the quality and accuracy control has reached the world's advanced level. In
terms of shipbuilding, China already has the three most difficult shipbuilding
technologies to produce LNG, luxury cruise ships, and large ocean-going cargo
ships. China has topped the global offshore order list for five consecutive
years, and a total of 73 offshore orders will be received in 2023. In 2023,
China's shipbuilding completions, new orders, and hand-held orders will account
for 49.7%, 67%, and 54.4% of the world's market share, respectively, and the
market share of large-scale offshore equipment will continue to maintain a
leading position in the world. Chinese shipbuilding 2024 already accounts for
70% of global orders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In terms of
high-speed rail technology, China has built a 45,000-kilometer high-speed
railway network, accounting for more than 50% of the world's total mileage,
making it the country with the longest operating mileage of high-speed railways
in the world, and high-speed rail technology and services are also exported to
Indonesia and other countries. Recently, China's high-speed rail has further
completed the speed test, with a maximum speed of 450 kilometers per hour, and
a new generation of maglev high-speed railway with a speed of 1,000 kilometers
per hour has also been tested in Shanxi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In addition,
in 2023, the scale of China's agricultural machinery and equipment industry
will reach 293.71 billion yuan, with an export value of 6.36 billion US
dollars. It has also achieved results in the research and development of a
number of emerging materials, maintaining a catch-up or leading position in the
forefront of 128 fields around the world, and new materials are widely used in
various fields, and the output value is gradually emerging. In terms of
biomedicine and high-performance medical devices, Chinese companies have been
able to independently design and manufacture the world's most advanced
superconducting magnetic resonance systems, some anti-cancer drugs have begun
to enter the U.S. market, China's self-sufficiency in the field of biomedicine
and high-performance medical devices has been enhanced, and the value of
industrial output has been continuously improved. High-end medical devices and
some key new materials and other fields are still dependent on imports, and the
self-sufficiency rate is low, which is the direction that needs to be focused
on breakthroughs in the future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In terms of
information technology, China has built the world's most advanced 5G equipment
manufacturing industry chain and 5G network, with more than 4 million 5G base
stations, nearly 20 times that of the United States. The semiconductor
equipment industry chain has basically begun to be completed. The independent
system has been successful, and the server system has accounted for more than
half of the Chinese market last year. For low-end chips above 28nm, China has
the world's largest production capacity. Of course, domestic semiconductor
production capacity still needs to be improved, especially for high-end chips.
At present, the main breakthrough in this field should be that key equipment
and materials, including lithography machines, are still affected by Western
export restrictions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>Looking back
10 years, &quot;Made in China 2025&quot; is no longer a grand plan on paper,
and it has to be said that the sudden national stop mentioning &quot;Made in
China 2025&quot; reflects a broader political strategy. First, controversy was
avoided, and further international concerns and protectionist reactions were
avoided. At the same time, this silence underscores China's strategic
pragmatism, adapting its approach while achieving long-term economic goals. It
has to be said that the style of doing things at the top of the central
government fully demonstrates the subtlety of oriental culture. This
implication shows two characteristics: insurance, conservatism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>In 2015,
&quot;Made in China 2025&quot; was unveiled with a high profile, and then it
was immediately silent. In the next 10 years, the term almost disappeared. For
a long time, it made the Chinese people feel aggrieved and even guilty. Because
you have to endure and let go. But now, although the international situation
has changed abruptly in recent years and suffered a century-long pattern
fission, China's international status and comprehensive strength have been
greatly improved. But standing at the height of the country, in the contest of
top high-tech, it is completely correct to be conservative and low-key.</span></p>

Technology's humanoid robot appeared in the 2025 Spring Festival Gala
performance program &quot;Yang Bot&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>It has to be
said that now the &quot;Made in China 2025&quot; plan has achieved remarkable
phased results, and the rise of China's science and technology has formed a
&quot;triple helix&quot; response: the combination of government guidance +
market drive + engineer dividends, which is rewriting the traditional division
of labor of &quot;Western R&amp;D - Made in China&quot;. As the German magazine
Der Spiegel put it: &quot;This is not a simple industrial competition, but a
technological paradigm shift at the civilizational level&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>Indeed, as a
direct result of the persistence and promotion of the &quot;Made in China
2025&quot; plan, Chinese society has undergone profound changes: Chinese
consumers have now purchased more electric vehicles than fossil fuel vehicles,
and the most popular ones are local brands such as BYD and Xiaomi; Chinese-made
C919 airliners have begun to serve some of the busiest routes; The widespread
adoption of 5G technology allows rail passengers to enjoy high-speed networks
even when passing through tunnels; has more smart factories and automated
terminals than any other country; The market size of mobile phones and
computers using domestic chips and systems is expanding; China's shipbuilding
capacity has exceeded that of the United States by more than 200 times......</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>And that's
just the beginning. In fact, China not only has Made in China 2025, but also
Chinese Standard 2035. If Made in China 2025 is to improve China's
manufacturing capacity, then China Standard 2035 is to give China a say in the
formulation of international technical standards. &quot;Made in China
2025&quot; focuses on improving China's manufacturing capacity and
technological self-sufficiency, while &quot;China Standard 2035&quot; seeks to
capitalize on these achievements by setting global technical standards. Every
step of the way will have far-reaching implications for trade, technology and
international relations. In 2023, Xi Jinping proposed &quot;new quality
productivity&quot; on this basis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>&quot;Made
in China 2025&quot; is the catalyst for the rise of China's industry, and
&quot;China Standard 2035&quot; indicates a more complex and ambitious
strategy, with a new focus on establishing global technical standards, which
marks a shift in strategic priorities, not just to make products, but also to
define how products are manufactured and used on a global scale. As for the
proposal of &quot;new quality productivity&quot;, it is the quality of advanced
productivity born from further technological revolutionary breakthroughs, innovative
allocation of production factors, and in-depth industrial transformation and
upgrading. The so-called high-quality development no longer stays at the level
of utensils, but also leverages the optimization of laborers, labor materials,
and labor objects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>Of course,
it will be more difficult for China's manufacturing industry to continue to
break through in the future. It must be noted that the West has put more
pressure on Chinese manufacturing in technology and market. The West could
launch a new round of trade wars and sanctions at any time in the face of
high-quality, low-cost high-tech products from China, especially in
photovoltaics, large wind turbines and electric vehicles. Although looking at
the restrictive measures taken by the West so far, the effectiveness is limited
and sometimes even counterproductive. However, in the face of the escalation of
its measures, it should be treated differently and should not be taken lightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%'>At the same
time, various countries have also introduced various industrial plans, such as
the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry launched the manufacturing
digital upgrade plan, France also launched the &quot;New Industrial
France&quot; plan, the United States' &quot;Chips and Science Act&quot; and
&quot;Inflation Reduction Act&quot;, the European Union also passed the
&quot;National Aid Plan&quot; and the &quot;Chips Act&quot;, etc., which means
that the future manufacturing international competition is much more fierce
than in the previous 10 years.</span></p>
